# Introduction

# Rules and Guidelines
Rules text

# Prerequisites
1. You must be able to compile a wallet or have access to someone who can (so you can test it!)
2. Ability to use a graphics program (to design, tweak and resize the icons and images as needed)
3. Ability to read and modify CSS (this file will control the colors, font sizes as well as certain images like the background image)

# Instructions
1. Download and modify this theme template (based on Tech currently as it has all of the features active in css) here:
https://github.com/AtheneumChain/Themes/raw/master/Theme_Template.zip
2. Extract the files then modify or replace them with your graphics program
3. Modify the CSS as required to match the new colors of your theme
4. Test your theme (requires the ability to compile the wallet)
5. Repackage (zip) the files exactly as they originally were named and located (don't rename anything at all - we'll take care of replacing the code in the right places with the name of your theme)
6. Submit the file via discord under the "#theme-competition" channel with the theme name, a screenshot of the theme applied to an Atheneum wallet and the zip file (should be under 1mb. If it isn't, the images aren't optimized)

# To Compile and Test:

1. Please make sure you place the folder ` new_theme ` under the icons folder in src/qt/res:
![Image placehere](https://github.com/AtheneumChain/Themes/raw/master/savehere.png) </br>

2. place the ` new_theme.css ` file in the same directory as the other css files: /src/qt/res/css:

3. compile as usual and test your theme. Don't forget to take a screenshot!

### Good Luck !
